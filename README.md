# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project is a classification-based machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on their personal and financial details.
The aim is to help financial institutions automate and speed up the loan approval process while reducing risks.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data Cleaning & Manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Classification Models)

Jupyter Notebook – Development & Analysis

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains applicant details such as:

Applicant Income

Coapplicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit History

Gender, Education, Property Area

Loan Status (Target Variable)

🔍 Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized income distribution, loan amount patterns, and approval trends

Analyzed categorical features like gender, education, and credit history

Model Building

Implemented classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Used GridSearchCV and Cross-validation to tune hyperparameters

Model Evaluation

Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Selected the best-performing model

📊 Results

The best model achieved high accuracy in predicting loan eligibility.

Credit history and applicant income were found to be the most important factors.

🚀 Future Improvements

Deploy the model using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit

Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI / Tableau

Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms like XGBoost
